					<p>The ERRS has grown into the largest fleet of heritage electric streetcars in Western Canada. <br><br>Our collection includes 9 operational streetcars, plus 17 others! Two of these are currently being restored, two are complete, but in non-operational condition, and the remaining 13 await eventual restoration or rebuilding by our volunteers.<br><br>Our aim is to restore at least one car of every type that has operated in Edmonton. We also hope to restore other significant streetcars from other cities and even other countries. </p>

							<p class="half-space-above">The Edmonton 1 was built in 1908 by the Ottawa Car Co. and was the second car to arrive in Edmonton before the opening of the new streetcar network. It was converted into a one-man, single-end car in the 1930s, and operated until 1951. <br><br>The car was stored outside for more than a decade, suffering significant damage. However, volunteers restored the car. The wooden body of the streetcar is still in nearly the same condition as it was when it performed it’s last service!<br><br>The car was able to operate across the High-Level Bridge in 1979, for Edmonton’s 75 anniversary with the help of a generator trailer.<br><br>In 1841, it became the Edmonton Radial Railway Society’s first operational Streetcar!</p>

					<p class="half-space-above">Restoration is not an easy task, as streetcar bodies are often in very poor condition. They take many years of work, and many volunteers to restore back to operating condition. <br><br>In most cases, the cars have to be built from scratch, using what remains of the original car as a guide. <br><br>Replacements for missing trucks, motors, controllers, compressors and other vital  equipment often has to be searched for around the world or even  manufactured in our own workshop. It is therefore not surprising that  some projects take as long as 20 years and thousands of volunteer hours  to complete.</p>
