						<h3>How it all Began</h3>
						<p>Streetcar service in Edmonton ended in  September 1951, when all but one car were scrapped or sold. <br><br>The preserved car #1 sat outside the Cromdale car barn for over a  decade and suffered severe damage from weather and vandalism. It was not until 1964 that first efforts were made towards restoration to showcase the artifact in the 1967 Centennial Parade. <br><br>Much restoration was required to make #1 operational again under its own power. In 1979 trips across the High Level Bridge (with the help of a diesel generator) were organised to celebrate Edmonton's 75th anniversary  during the Thanksgiving Weekend. <br><br>As a result of this success, the Edmonton Radial Railway Society (ERRS) was formed and  incorporated as an Alberta Society in early 1980. <br><br>The development of Fort Edmonton Park called for a streetcar line in the  Park and an agreement between the Fort Edmonton Foundation, the ERRS and the City of Edmonton was reached. <br><br>In 1981 streetcar #1 operated briefly over the railway tracks using a diesel generator to provide the power.  Over the next three years the current track system and overhead lines  were constructed. <br><br>On June 10, 1984 members of the ERRS started regular  streetcar service at Fort Edmonton Park. Since these early days a number of displaced streetcar bodies were found and brought back after having  served as cottages, pig barns or even roadside diners. ERRS members set  to work and made sure that more restored cars would join the fleet. <br><br>Edmonton Radial Railway Streetcar #1 was closely followed by Edmonton Streetcar #42. The body  of this vehicle served for many years as a cottage near Sylvan Lake  before being recovered and restored by ERRS members. This car now  carries the main workload at Fort Edmonton Park. <br><br>The most modern  streetcars ever to operate in our City were five steel bodied cars, delivered in 1930 by the Ottawa Car Manufacturing Co. The only survivor  is car #80, the body of which found further use in British Columbia as a roadside diner in Dawson Creek and later as a farm building in Fort St. John. 20 years of hard volunteer work have turned the car into as new  condition, making it the pride of our fleet. Two cars from Ontario  (Toronto Suburban #24 and Toronto PCC#4612) presently complete the fleet at Fort Edmonton Park. Further restoration projects are well under way. <br><br>Every year members volunteer between 12,000 and 15,000 hours to keep restoring more cars. <br><br>The jobs include metal work, wood work, machining, upholstery, painting,  electrical wiring, fitting of air brakes, track work, administration,  museum guides and streetcar operations. <br><br>From May to October streetcars operate in Fort Edmonton Park and on the High Level Bridge with extended hours during the excitement of  the Fringe Festival. Drivers and conductors who enjoy people and have a  love for the history of Edmonton are needed to keep these operations  running smoothly. <br><br>New and dedicated members are always welcome! The  ERRS has a lively operating schedule, and lack of work will never be a problem. The society promotes major efforts to rebuild and operate historic  streetcars, to obtain or manufacture missing parts thereby enabling future generations to carry on the restoration work.<br><br>It is this continued volunteer effort, which keeps Edmonton's  history alive!</p>

						<h3 class="txt-uppercase">What is a Streetcar?</h3>
						<p>A streetcar is a public transportation vehicle (car) that runs on rails laid down on the street. It can also be called a trolley or a trolley-car, and outside North America in English speaking countries it is referred to as a tram or tramcar.</p>

						<h3 class="txt-uppercase">Streetcars vs. LRTs</h3>
						<p>Many modern streetcar lines use new rolling stock that is not very different from urban LRT rolling stock. However, they are distinct from  high-floor and low-floor LRT  in how they are  constructed and run. <br><br>High-floor LRTs are  characterized by high-floor rolling stock that requires specialized  platforms for the loading and unloading of passengers. These lines  require greater infrastructural investments (e.g. big stations) than streetcars or low-floor LRT lines. Because of this, stops are typically  spaced further apart than streetcar or low-floor LRT stops. Stations are often 600 meters apart.</p>

					<div class="narrow-txt-box">
						<p><br>The Valley Line is Edmonton's only low-floor LRT line. Low-Floor LRT is very  different from high-floor LRT because it fits better into  neighbourhoods. Low-floor stops do not need to be elaborate stations.  They can be as simple (and inexpensive) as a raised curb and standard  bus shelter. <br><br>It can be difficult to spot the differences between modern streetcar  services, and low-floor LRT. Low-floor LRT stops are usually spaced  further apart than streetcar stops, but closer together than high-floor  LRT stations. <br><br>Low-floor LRT lines will typically have reserved  right-of-ways, priority at intersections, and not operate in mixed  traffic. <br><br>Low-floor LRT cars are also more likely than streetcars to be  coupled together for more capacity. Essentially, low-floor LRT lines  have the potential to operate faster, and move more passengers, than  streetcar lines.</p>

						<h3>Streetcars History</h3>
						<h4 class="p txt-bold">How it began</h4>
						<p>In New York around 1830 a young Irishman, John Stephenson, had a  brainwave! Why not run a railroad along a street? He developed the idea  and the first public streetcar line was opened in New York on November  26, 1832. The cars were hauled by horses.<br><br>The "street railway" idea slowly began to spread. New Orleans ran its first streetcars in 1834, and by the 1880's most major cities in the U.S. and Europe were running horse-drawn streetcars. Their great advantage over  horse-drawn omnibuses was the "smooth" ride provided by steel wheels  running on steel rails. Bus passengers had a dreadful ride over very uneven and rutted street surfaces.<br><br>Although early streetcars were  horse-drawn, other methods of motion were included cable haulage (still  in use in San Francisco) and steam haulage (especially in the British  Isles and Europe where the cars were actually towed by small steam  engines along the streets!) These early modes of traction were soon to  become obsolete because of the new miracle of the age - electricity!<br><br><br></p>
						<h4 class="p txt-bold">The Electric Era</h4>
						<p>With the development of the electric motor the streetcar industry was  revolutionized and this led to an enormous increase in the number of  systems throughout the world. <br><br>Compared to other modes of transportation, the electric streetcar was fast, frequent, clean, reliable and  inexpensive to operate. It provided easy travel to all parts of cities.  By the early 1900s virtually every city in North America had a streetcar system, and indeed these contributed to the growth and expansion of  many cities.<br><br>Electricity was normally supplied by an overhead wire system where the cars picked  up the current with a long pole fixed to the roof of each car. This was  simple and relatively cheap to construct as well as being easy to adjust and repair. Later in some areas (especially European cities) the pole  was superseded by a bow collector or a pantograph. <br><br>In a few cities such  as London and Washington D.C. overhead wires were not permitted in the  central area and a conduit system was used for current collection. It  was picked up by means of a "plough" carried on the truck under the car  and passing down through a narrow slot provided in the conduit fixed  below the road surface.<br><br>Several manufacturers dominated the streetcar industry in North America.  Edmonton's first cars were supplied in 1908 by the Ottawa Car Manufacturing Company, and subsequent orders were placed with the St.  Louis Car Company and the Preston Car Manufacturing Company. Some cities built cars in their own workshops. As well, several companies such as  Brill and Peckham developed different designs of streetcar trucks and  these were supplied to the various car body manufacturers.<br><br><br></p>
						<h4 class="p txt-bold">Decline and the "PCC" Era</h4>
						<p>While streetcars were dominant for many years, the introduction of the motor bus  and the private automobiles led to stiff competition. <br><br>To challenge rising costs and falling receipts, a prototype car of a revolutionary design  was unveiled in 1934. This P.C.C. (Presidents' Conference Committee)  streetcar accelerated smoothly instead of jerking from one notch of the  controller to the other. The driver sat at a control console and  operated the car by an organ-pedal accelerator. <br><br>With lightweight motors  and rubber-cushioned wheels the car glided along almost noiselessly.  Hopes were high that this new design would attract riders back to  streetcars and challenge bus competition. By 1940 some 1,100 PCC cars  had been built for many of the major operators in the United States.<br><br>Many cities, including Edmonton, continued to operate electric streetcars  through World War II. Fuel restrictions lead to record passenger loads,  resulting in worn-out cars and tracks. Those cities that had not updated their fleets were now reluctant to make a major capital investment to  rehabilitate their track and rolling stock, the result being that many  systems closed down. (In Europe, apart from the United Kingdom,  streetcars continued to play a major role in public transportation.)  Trolleybus or diesel bus substitution became the order of the day. The  PCC car had arrived on the scene too late to stop the tide of streetcar  abandonment.<br><br><br></p>
						<h4 class="p txt-bold">Revival - The "Light Rail" (LRT) Era</h4>
						<p>By the end of the 1960s a mere handful of cities in North America  (including Toronto) continued to operate streetcars. In Europe, the vast majority of cities retained their streetcar systems. Experiencing economic recovery and  redevelopment after World War II, most of these cities obtained new  streetcars, moved tracks to stretches of private right-of-way, and in  some cases put tracks in tunnels.<br><br>These efficient systems became the forerunners of what we now refer to as "light rail" or LRT. The  flexibility and relatively inexpensive cost of construction made such  systems an attractive alternative to "heavy" rapid transit subways or  metros. This has become the preferred mode of mass transit for cities  with populations below one million. Edmonton was the first North  American city to operate an LRT line, which opened in 1978.</p>
